2. **Shots on Target (%):** Percentage of total shots that hit the target.
3. **Off-Target Attempts:** Count of shots missing the target entirely.

## Visual Insights
A graph has been created to illustrate these statistics, enabling comparisons between managers and identifying trends in Manchester United's attacking performances.

### Key Observations
- **Consistent Struggles with Finishing:** Most managers experienced low conversion rates, reflecting inefficiency in front of goal.
- **Variability in Shot Accuracy:** Shots on target percentages fluctuated, but no manager achieved sustained efficiency.
- **High Off-Target Attempts:** A recurring pattern of wasted opportunities highlights a persistent issue with precision.

### Individual Manager Insights
- **David Moyes:** Mixed attacking displays with some promise but inconsistent accuracy.
- **Louis van Gaal:** Focused on possession but lacked cutting edge in the final third.
- **Jose Mourinho:** Improved defensive structure but faced similar attacking inefficiencies.
- **Ole Gunnar Solskjaer:** Bright start but struggled with finishing consistency over time.
- **Erik ten Hag:** Recent data suggests improvements in buildup but continued issues converting chances.
- **Ruben Amorim:** Appointed in November 2024, Amorim has already faced challenges balancing results with attacking performances. While he secured notable wins, including a Manchester Derby victory, poor finishing and shot inefficiencies remain recurring themes. His focus on improving standards and addressing internal issues highlights the urgency to enhance attacking precision.


## Conclusion
The comparison highlights a recurring theme of poor finishing across managerial regimes. Despite tactical differences, Manchester United has consistently struggled to turn possession and shots into goals, emphasizing the need for improved attacking efficiency.

## Next Steps
- Expand the dataset to analyze more matches under each manager.
- Include additional metrics, such as xG and shot locations, for deeper insights.
- Investigate defensive trends to provide a more holistic evaluation.
